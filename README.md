# minecraftServerInstall
This is a shell script to install Minecraft server with forge.

There are a lot of things to do.

# To do List
1.Change ~/ to any path that user want to install to, using veriable $installPath.  
2.Improve input check function.  
3.It seems like forge-$forgeversion-installer.jar can install minecraft server directly.  
4.Fix some logic error.  
5.Optimized redundant code.  
6.Check the error paste in line 95.#Problem is that 0 input or 1 input this loop will exit. This may fixed?
