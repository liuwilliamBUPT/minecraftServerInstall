# minecraftServerInstaller
This is a shell script to install Minecraft server with forge.

There are a lot of things to do.

# To do List 
1.It seems like forge-$forgeversion-installer.jar can install minecraft server directly, when there is not minecraft_server.$version.jar.  
2.Fix some logic error.  
3.Optimized redundant code.  
4.Make it possible to accept parameters.
