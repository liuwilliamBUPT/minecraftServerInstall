# minecraftServerInstaller
This is a shell script to install Minecraft server with forge.

There are a lot of things to do.

# To do List
1.Change ~/ to any path that user want to install to, using veriable $installPath.  
2.Improve input check function.  
3.It seems like forge-$forgeversion-installer.jar can install minecraft server directly, when there is not minecraft_server.$version.jar.  
4.Fix some logic error.  
5.Optimized redundant code.
